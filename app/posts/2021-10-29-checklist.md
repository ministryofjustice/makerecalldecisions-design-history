## Starting information

The idea for the checklist came through in the discovery research. Nisha Bakshi our SME produced a checklist for the NW cluster work which covers questions that she expects probation practitioners to work through to encourage ‘system 2 thinking’ (slower, analytical thinking where reason dominates - this leads to more objective, less reactive decisions about recall)

Type of questions an offender manager has to ask themselves in arriving at a decision are:
* Have you obtained all available information to help you understand the behaviour(s) currently causing concern, so that an informed and defensible decision can be made?
* How credible is the information?  Have you completed the necessary checks with the police or other agencies involved with the offender? If there is information from police colleagues, what is the grading of the intelligence?
* Do any changes in behaviour reflect actions displayed during previous harmful offending – for example, return to mixing with previous associates, or increased substance use? Are there concerns with regard to potential impact on victims?
* Has a conversation taken place with the lead agencies on the risk management plan, to establish if they share the concerns and whether they can provide further support/alternative provisions?
* What does good compliance look like for this offender? Are there extenuating circumstances as to why they have been unable to attend a probation appointment?  Is a degree of flexibility required and is it defensible?
* Would the offender continuing to engage in a given activity raise his/her risk of harm or re-offending or is it part of a pattern of behaviour that requires the NPS and its partners to identify and deliver long-term rehabilitative interventions? An example here would be the case of an offender relapsing into drug misuse but where there is no history of it being a causative factor in seriously harmful behaviour.
* How long has the offender been in the community for?  Is s/he struggling to adapt to the relative freedoms of life in the community compared to custody? Is this the offender’s first breach of licence and, if so, is it sufficiently serious to warrant recall?
* Have you considered any conscious or unconscious bias you may hold towards the offender or his/her situation?
* Is the offender on a short licence and due to transition into the Post Sentence Supervision (PSS) period? Depending on the seriousness of the breach, could other measures which support and focus on rehabilitation be identified and implemented?
* Is the offender approaching his/her sentence end date (SED)? Depending on the seriousness of the licence breach, have you considered whether recall at this stage could increase risk, if the offender is then released without any support or controls?
* What protective factors are in place and what has worked previously to help secure compliance, motivation and manage risk? Would recalling the offender have an adverse impact on any of the protective factors?
* Has the offender been screened into the Offender Personality Disorder (OPD) Pathway and a case formulation completed? Has there been a consultation with the specialist PO and psychologist?
* What contingencies are in place on the risk management plan? Can any be activated?
* Does the contingency outline what types of behaviour would meet the threshold for an out of hours recall? Can a defensible decision be made by the out of hours Head of Function/Service, when the offender manager is not available?
* Have you had a reflective discussion with your SPO to explore potential options and explain the rationale

## Testing
In the first prototype we tested a simplified ‘check your answers’ checklist to see if it would encourage people to consider each tab or part of the case summary. The questions were specific to the case summary information.

## Findings

Whilst there was some value in these to enforce a pause in the process between reading the case summary information and recording a recommendation, the questions needed to encourage the probation practitioners to think outside of the information they’d just read to prompt system 2 thinking. User research participants mentioned other questions they would want to consider as part of this process which matched the original NW cluster questions our SME had provided.

>“We would consider most of these things in our heads. I think this is really useful - this is more useful than anything (no offence)”

>“It would be useful if there was guidance ‘have you checked alternatives, can they be managed, instead of just recall recall - it’s not as straightforward as that.”

>“Ultimately it is about imminence of risk and not being able to be managed in the community.”

>“Have they been arrested, is there a charge sheet, look at police logs. Before doing a recall I’d want to get in touch with the service user to speak to them. If they're out of touch I’d want to discuss with another colleague or SPO on what their thoughts are.”

>“I wouldn't be recording my recommendation yet. I'd do it after a discussion with my SPO.”

>“yes that's good. These are things I would certainly think It's a prompt, you sometimes focus on 1 bit for recall but this would allow you to develop it a bit more in your thinking.”

We returned to the original list of questions which had worked well in the NW cluster, but simplified the language to bring it in line with GDS standards. We grouped the questions into themes and put them on different pages to further slow the journey between case information, consideration and decision.

Users also wanted to interact with the checklist rather than just read a static list of questions.

>“You check this then make a recommendation? You just read it? You're not ticking?”

>“These need to be boxes you can click into. How imminent is the risk, there would be things like could happen at any moment at any time.”
