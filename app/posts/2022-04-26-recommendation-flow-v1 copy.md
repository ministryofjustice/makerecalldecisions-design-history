## Recommendation flow
Building on the checklist from the NW region's this work this piece of work iterated on the feedback from users at the end of alpha. This work looks to make the checklist into a more provocative stimulus provoking users to consider the whole-picture of the person when deciding whether to recall.

Work started with collating guidance from various training, policy documents and an internal review. All documents listed pointers and considerations before recalling. 

Once common recommendations and guidance were consolidated the primary themes were made into a series of question pages. Each page approached a theme when considering recall; immediate risk, vulnerability, current circumstances, alternatives, and reviewing current protective factors. (Protective factors is a term used by probation officers which covers all the support and constructive elements that can aid a person in rehabilition. e.g. accommodation, family, employment etc)

### Quotes from users

> "I really like this form, If I was having to recall someone I didn't know, this would make my life easier, look at all the things that need to be in place, discussions happening, not 100% getting you to look at have you thought about abs everything, have you covered everything 
"
>

> "I would be concerned if we hadn't had a conversation with SPO. It's an aide memoire, a duplication of information that you've already got in your head. I think that would add work for me, not otherwise. "

>I already have knowledge of the case. May be helpful for someone less experienced, or if recall isn't clear cut. Useful if pre-population of static factors -- some of the risk factors
