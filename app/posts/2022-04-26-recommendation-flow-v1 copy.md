## Iterating the ‘make a recommendation’ feature
The alpha prototype included a recommendation checklist. It had questions for users to work through before making a recommendation. It was based on a paper checklist already used in the north-west region.

We wanted to build on this idea to see if we could make it more interactive. The aim was to create something that would: 

* give practitioners a moment to pause and consider their decisions
* think about the whole picture of the person on probation

We wanted to encourage ‘system 2 thinking’. Using a structured checklist to do this is a strategy from psychology. System 2 thinking is slower, more analytical thinking that hopefully helps people make decisions that are unbiased and rational.

The design challenge is to introduce friction that will slow down knee-jerk intuitive decision making, as this can be accidentally biased. But this friction is something that can also annoy users.

To start this work, we:
* looked at feedback from users at the end of alpha 
* reviewed recall policy, training and guidance documents

Then we created a list of things that practitioners consider before making a recall decision. We grouped them into themes. We used these themes to create a series of pages with questions and prompts about:
* the immediate risk
* who is vulnerable 
* the person on probation’s current circumstances
* alternatives to recall
* protective factors

Protective factors are things that help a person on probation to integrate back into the community. They can include:
* support from family and friends
* employment
* having somewhere to live
* support programmes (for example, drugs or alcohol rehabilitation)
