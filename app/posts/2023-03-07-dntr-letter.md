  title: Creating a decision not to recall letter
  description: A way for practitioners to create a letter explaining why they’ve decided not to recall a person on probation

There’s always an incident or escalating concern that leads to a decision to recall a person on.  

If someone breaches their licence conditions, a practitioner might decide that they do not need to be recalled. This is because they think the risk is manageable in the community. 

When this happens, the person on probation gets a decision not to recall letter.

The letter explains:
* what the licence breach is and why it’s a problem
* what the person on probation thinks about the licence breach
* why the person is not being recalled
* what progress they’ve made so far
* what’s expected of them in the future

### Helping practitioners write better letters
At the moment, practitioners or case adminstrators use a Word template to write decision not to recall letters. Parts of the template are locked for editing, so they are the same across all the letters that get sent out. There are other parts of the letter that the practitioner or case administrator will fill in.

Some of the language in the existing template is hard to understand. The prompts in the template are brief and do not offer any guidance about language, tone or what should be included.

We built a decision not to recall flow in our service with a series of questions and prompts. The aim was to help practitioners create the decision not to recall letter without having to use the existing template. This would mean our service could be used for either a decision to recall someone or a decision not to recall someone.

In parallel with this work, our content designer worked with a subject matter expert to rewrite the existing letter template and reword sections of it into simpler English. The new version of the letter is currently with senior managers for review.

### User research - what we did
We have spoken to early adopters that have been using our service. We have analytics that tell us when a practitioner has created a decision not to recall letter, and we have followed up with some of the users who have done this. 

We have also tested the decision not to recall flow with participants with no prior experience or knowledge of our service. This was to find out how clear the steps were to novices and if they were in line with their processes/ways of working. 

### Research findings
Practitioners told us that writing a decision not to recall letter through our service was more time-consuming because this task would normally be done by a case administrator. However, they also told us that the quality of the letters had improved. 

Quotes from users:

> “It’s more time consuming because we have to write the letters ourselves but the quality has improved.”

> “The improved quality of the letters trumped the fact that this gave us extra work.”

> “Having read a number of decision not to recall letters, I did think that the standard was much better.”

### Next steps
After working with the subject matter expert on the proposed new decision not to recall letter, we realised that some of our prompts could be improved to make the letters easier to write. We will change the prompts as a result of this work. If the proposed new letter gets approved, we will also change the flow of our questions because some of them will no longer be needed.

We would also like to test the letter with people on probation.
