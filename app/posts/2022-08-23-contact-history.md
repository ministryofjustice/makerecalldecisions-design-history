### Moving away from the licence history timeline
The alpha prototype included a licence history timeline.

The idea was that the service could curate important events in the history of a person on licence. We could highlight significant things like when someone started on licence, previous recalls, missed appointments, failed drug tests or interactions with the police. 

The hope was that the timeline would help probation practitioners to:
* see behaviour and compliance over the course of a licence at a glance
* make an informed decision about recall 

However, it soon became clear that curating events like this would be very difficult. The contacts coming from NDelius were patchy, sometimes confusingly labelled and inconsistent. This meant that there was no way of highlighting the most significant events.

So we switched focus to developing a contact history instead. This contact history put the power in the hands of the practitioner to find significant contacts and filter out the noise. The user could also narrow down contacts to ones they knew would be useful, which might depend on the case.

We’re trialling a few features to help practitioners use the contact history. These include:
* date filters
* a text search 
* contact categories
* filter tags

Date filtering is potentially useful for practitioners who want to limit the view to a particular licence period or other specific timespan - for example, a previous recall. 

Contact filtering using categories could help users find and filter specific contacts to help them spot patterns of behaviour to help make a decision. There are contact categories in NDelius, but we wanted to try to improve upon this. We wanted to see if we could come up with some new categories that made sense to users.

We began by looking at the most-used contact types in NDelius and started organising them into groups. 

We used a sample of contacts from across HMPSS in a six month period. There were over 8000 contacts to examine, but we managed to make new groupings for 96% of the most used contacts.

A large amount were automatically generated by NDelius and NOMIS, these we discounted as users told us they added noise and made the lists hard to scan.

### User research - what we did

As a starting point, we asked a group of SMEs to review the filter categories as a list in a spreadsheet. The list was very long, so we wanted to make sure they were useful before putting them into our prototype.

#### Step 1
We asked 3 SMEs to review the spreadsheet and give us their feedback. We then decided that some contacts would need to be in more than one category. We used the feedback from SMEs to update the spreadsheet.

#### Step 2
We asked the SMEs to review the 4% of contacts that were not in our list, in case any of them were especially relevant to recalls. Some were, so we added them into the categories in line with SMEs’ suggestions.

#### Step 3
4 practitioners reviewed the updated spreadsheet of contacts and groupings that the SMEs had previously looked at. We briefed them on a call and then they did the review in their own time, emailing back their comments to us.
Research findings

Our findings from this round of research only look at the groupings and labels, not at how they’d be used on the page.

We used the research process to iterate the spreadsheet.

The next step is to incorporate the feedback (from the practitioners in step 3) into the spreadsheet. We can then add the contact categories to the prototype and test them with users.  

We know that the categories make sense to people, but need to find out whether they are usable and validate that they make sense in the context of actually doing a recall and looking for relevant contacts.
