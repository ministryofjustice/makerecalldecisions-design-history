## Iterating the ‘make a recommendation’ feature
The alpha prototype included a recommendation checklist. It had questions for users to work through before making a recommendation. It was based on a paper checklist already used in the north-west region.

We wanted to build on this idea to see if we could make it more interactive. The aim was to create something that would: 

* give practitioners a moment to pause and consider their decisions
* think about the whole picture of the person on probation

We wanted to encourage ‘system 2 thinking’. Using a structured checklist to do this is a strategy from psychology. System 2 thinking is slower, more analytical thinking that hopefully helps people make decisions that are unbiased and rational.

The design challenge is to introduce friction that will slow down knee-jerk intuitive decision making, as this can be accidentally biased. But this friction is something that can also annoy users.

To start this work, we:
* looked at feedback from users at the end of alpha 
* reviewed recall policy, training and guidance documents

Then we created a list of things that practitioners consider before making a recall decision. We grouped them into themes. We used these themes to create a series of pages with questions and prompts about:
* the immediate risk
* who is vulnerable 
* the person on probation’s current circumstances
* alternatives to recall
* protective factors

Protective factors are things that help a person on probation to integrate back into the community. They can include:
* support from family and friends
* employment
* having somewhere to live
* support programmes (for example, drugs or alcohol rehabilitation)

### User research - what we did
We conducted research with a variety of users that included:

* probation practitioners
* senior probation officers
* assistant chief officers

We asked questions about the decision making process and also observed users interacting with the new checklist. We wanted to learn how they develop and record the rationale behind a decision.

This let us see how our prompts fit with current practices – whether they compliment or duplicate them. We also tested whether the prompts were:

* understandable
* relevant
* easy to answer

Some of the questions in the checklist are about facts, for example: 

Has the person on probation been considered for recall before? 

Others are questions of judgement, like:

If the behaviour continues, will it increase the risk? 


### Research Findings
Some users welcomed the prompts to reflect on questions of judgement. But they expected the system to provide - not ask for - answers to factual questions. This is because these facts appear elsewhere within the service (or other connected services) already. 

Users saw this as unnecessary duplicate work. 

> “I'm going to be writing stuff twice.” 

> “To me as a practitioner, this looks like another form at a time when I'm swamped with forms.” 

Users need to preserve their time and cognitive resources to make decisions. So rather than introduce new or duplicate tasks, the design challenge is for the service to replace decision processing tasks they do already. 

> “It's being recorded in NDelius, which is really great, because that means I haven't got to go into another program and type the result and duplicate what I've just done.” 

> “For this to then (complete) other bits of the process, that's helpful.”
