## Starting information

Probation practitioners need to make evidence-based decisions that they can robustly defend if needed.

Having a way to record that they have used the case summary in their decision making process came out as a strong user need in the first round of user research.

>“That’s what makes you defensible is the paper trail of decisions made and increases in risk management.”

>“Is it just a checklist for us to make a decision? Is there something in here where you’d go in and put your decision or is it completely separate and we put the decision in Delius.
There has to be a point to this, does it get saved to the record? Do we just look at it and then it’s gone?”

>“Maybe you’d need a new button on Delius to say you’ve read or viewed this information. You could say you’ve used this and it validates the decision a bit more? Would there be buttons to add information or can you just view it here?
If nobody knows you’ve used it, it’s a wasted resource. A resource without validity.”

We added a ‘record your decision’ button and text box to meet this need. The use of ‘decision’ was met with anxiety because probation officers would be making a recommendation about whether to recall but the decision rests with more senior practitioners. We updated the button to ‘’record your recommendation’.

Having a way to record a decision not to recall was seen as a big benefit of the service. This is a place where the current audit trail is very weak so it’s a clear value of our service. Having a way for probation officers to record their rationale and present it to their SPO consistently was also seen as having value, especially in cases where there is a difference of opinion.

>“Adding as a note in the contact log is still useful, this going on as a professional judgement or conversation with SPO.”

>“It's a good opportunity to put the rationale in especially if you're not making the decision to recall.”

>“Having the opportunity to use this tool and put your recommendation regardless of what they (SPO) think would be really useful. I've been in a situation where you think it should be a recall and the SPO doesn't agree - it's awkward to go into Delius to say this is the decision but I don't agree. Having it here would be good, your reasoning is recorded really clearly as to why you thought or didn't think there should be a recall.”
