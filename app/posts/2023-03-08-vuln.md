  title: Displaying information about vulnerabilities
  description: How user research prompted us to create a new tab displaying vulnerability information

## User research - what we did
We wanted to find out about the recall process when:
* someone lives in an approved premises (AP)
* something happens outside standard working hours (6pm to 8am, Monday to Friday, all day at weekends)

When a person is released from prison, they might live in an AP as part of their rehabilitation back into the community. They will be supervised in the approved premises and will have to stick to certain rules and curfews. People who live in APs are usually medium to high risk people.
In September and October 2022 our user researchers visited APs in Bedford and Peterborough. 

Here, we spoke to:
* residential workers
* probation practitioners
* approved premises managers
* people on probation

Separately, we also spoke to five probation practitioners who regularly work out of hours. People who work out of hours often have to deal with problems in APs.

## Research findings
Several people told us that information about vulnerability issues was important. In an out of hours situation, the person on duty may not be familiar with the person on probation and they need to know about vulnerabilities. 

## User quotes: 

> “I need access to vulnerability issues and arrest issues to share with PPCS [Public Protection Casework Unit, which processes recalls] for recall”

“> I need a quick and easy way to access all the information on a case so I can make a balanced decision”

## How we changed the service based on this research
It was clear from this research that we needed to make it easy for people to find information about vulnerabilities. Useful information could be buried in any number of different NDelius contacts, so we couldn’t easily filter it via the contact history.

However, OASys - the system that displays information about risk - includes sections on vulnerabilities. We created a tab that displayed this information. The relevant sections have information about: 
* general concerns about vulnerability
* risk of suicide and/or self-harm
* the person’s ability to cope in custody or a hostel (AP)

We wanted to make it clear to users that the OASys information was not exhaustive, so we included a prompt to check the contact history as well.

## Next steps
We will continue to measure user feedback on this tab and iterate where necessary.
