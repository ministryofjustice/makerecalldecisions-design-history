### What leads to recall
There’s always an incident or escalating concern that leads to a decision to recall a person on probation.

The probation practitioner may notice the person on probation is demonstrating:
* an increased risk to the community
* worrying behaviour that mirrors that of their offence 

Our subject matter experts (SMEs) told us that the events that lead to recall can be misremembered and misreported by probation staff. The reason for recall also has to be reviewed by a senior probation officer (SPO) before a decision whether to recall or not is made.

### Designing a user journey

We designed an MVP user journey to record what causes a probation officer (PO) to consider recall.

To test the business need the SMEs had reported and see if there were any corresponding user needs, we needed to put our design in front of users before the end of Private Beta. 

We used the following process to design the journey rapidly:
* Wireframed 2 different user journeys for the ‘consider a recall’ journey using Miro.
* Worked with the wider scrum team and SMEs to decide which one was most viable.
* Designed the chosen journey in Figma, including the content design.
* Prototyped the journey using the GOV.UK prototyping kit. 

The journey included a ‘stop and think’ screen. This was designed to stop the PO after they had recorded what made them think about recalling the person on probation and get them to talk to their line manager (SPO) about it. They could only continue with their journey once the SPO had recorded their decision in the service.

### User research - what we did
We spoke to 5 practitioners who all had a minimum of 10 years’ experience each:
* 3 senior probation officers (SPOs)
* 2 probation practitioners (POs)

The sessions focused on the participants’ experience with the current recall process and the SPO and PO journeys for the ‘Consider a recall’ journey.

Overall there were mixed reviews on the ‘Consider a recall’ journey. Participants from both roles saw some benefits in having it. However, they were concerned that the friction the ‘stop and think’ screen creates would make it difficult to complete recalls if the SPO was temporarily unavailable to record their decision.

### Next steps

We need to carry out further testing on the ‘Consider a recall’ journey (ideally with real cases in a pre-prod environment) to understand how POs and SPOs would use it in a semi-real scenario.

We should also do some further research with other regions and specialist areas to understand what they would need from the service.
