## Risk information

### Risk management plan
The risk management plan was one of the original pieces of data that we were told is important when making a decision about recall. However when we did a card sort, it was not identified as useful by our participants. It was therefore not included in prototype test 2.

We heard from our research participants that it was important so we included it in prototype test 3. Users said that information in the risk management plan gives them context on how well the person on probation’s protective factors are working. Balancing positive behaviour with negative is a weakness in our case summary, so we were keen to include the risk management plan to strengthen this.

>“I’d be interested in how the personal circumstances relate to protective factors - who is supporting them? Are they engaging with agencies? It should be in the risk management plan”
“Where's the risk management plan, I'd want to  go back to that.”

### Contingency plan
In research round 3, participants told us that the part of the risk management plan that was very useful to them in the recall decision making process was the contingency plan.

>“Contingency plan should be its own thing in itself - risk management plan is what you're saying manages this person's risk. Contingency plan is what you've sid you'd do if things are going wrong. Having it hidden in a tab isn't enough, that's the whole reason we write these reports”

>“RMP is really important. Especially the contingency plan, that area is so important because you have to know what you are going to do.”

>“I'd be looking at the licence conditions and the contingency plan on what to do if certain things started to happen. It would guide your thinking depending on the severity of the behaviour.”

>“If you're looking at alternatives to recall the contingency plan should be in the risk details box.”

We pulled the contingency plan out of the risk management plan and put it at the top with the risk of serious harm summary information:



Further testing to prove whether this is the right place for the contingency plan would be useful. It feels like it could stand alone, with the risk management plan or be aligned with alternatives to recall in the mental model of probation practitioners.

### Risk visual language

The risk score graphics were well-received by our research participants:

>“I like the visual, easy to use.”
>“I like the temperature thing.”

Some said they would like the score ranges to be there too for extra context. We added this in prototype test 3.

>“If you could put the scores in there that would be good, green is 0 - 35 for example, to give context. I would like numbers as well.”
