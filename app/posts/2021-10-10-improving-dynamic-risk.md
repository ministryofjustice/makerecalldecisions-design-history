## Testing

Probation Practitioners need a common set of Dynamic Risk Factors that are used to make a quality, objective decision around whether a recall is needed. They need to filter contact log evidence pertinent to the events surrounding the recall. They need to use the Recall Decisions tool to formally log (on nDelius) their recommendation as a next step to escalate to a senior staff member.

* Improving the way we display dynamic risk factors
* Does the case summary work for warm POs
* How do we represent the triggering behaviour
* What is the end action, having used the tool
* What is the best set of risk factors that lead to the most objective decision making?
