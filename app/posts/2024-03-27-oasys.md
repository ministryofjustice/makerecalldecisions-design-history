## Risk section and overview page
When practitioners are assessing a person before recall they build a picture of the person. A risk assessment software called OASys is used to record lots of information about the circumstances around their offences. Many aspects are looked at when assessing risk factors for example;
* known people who are at risk
* what causes risk to increase
* victims
* children
* risk of self harm

Risk factors are all noted in detail. This information can be really useful to a practitioner to assess whether a live situation is a possible imminent recall. Four pertinent sections from the OASys assessment are displayed;
* R10.1 Who is at risk
* R10.12 what is the nature of the risk?
* R10.3 When is the risk likely to be greatest?
* R10.5 What factors are likely to reduce the risk?

### RoSH box (Risk of Serious Harm)
Probation has a longstanding matrix called RoSH score which they use to get an “at a glance” understanding of what risks surround a person. Another team had standardised the way this matrix displays. Users can you it to at a glance understand the main risks.


### Contingency plan
Two other important sections of the OASys are displayed on the overiew home page;
* 11.9 Contingency Plan
* 2.1 Brief offence(s) details

The contingency plan was highlighted as a key piece of information for probation. It helps them to think about ways to prevent a recall or look at ways to mitigate it, this can be very important during the fragile moments when considering a recall.

## Risk history
The design includes a risk timeline component, created by another internal HMPPS digital team. We further extended it by offering a way for significant events to display.

 If a RoSH score jumps from medium to high the timeline explicitly shows this incident, with a red badge "RoSH HIGH". A note is also available and a link to the contact log of that day. Users can then see what events happened on that day causing the increase. Practitioners today currently don’t have a quick way to see an significant incidents in the past. Often those incidents can be very close to recall and so something the practitioner needs to be aware of in detail.

Looking back over a history of an individual probation can get a quick understanding of the triggers and what instigates a jump in risk. This understanding helps inform their current decision making.
