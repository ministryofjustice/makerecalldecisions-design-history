## Creating a recommendation
Contacts (case notes) are used by probation practitioners when they’re considering whether to recall a person on probation and completing the Part A.

This iteration looked at using the questions about a recall recommendation to auto populate the Part A.

We also looked at how to use the contacts displayed in the contact history to help with this. We explored the idea of adding them as part of the evidence that’s used to explain a decision

### User research - what we did

We conducted research with 4 probation practitioners. 

2 of the practitioners are currently based in the community and 2 were based in the community until recently but are now working in court.

We showed the practitioners a prototype that was built in the development environment. This is more efficient than using a prototyping tool, as the work is reusable.

### Creating a fictitious person on probation

We created a fictitious person on probation that we called Duncann Cardours.

To avoid ethical issues around using real user data in research, we invented a scenario, sentence dates, and fictional contacts based on real contacts. 

We can also continue to develop the Duncann Cardours character for future research and testing.

### Research findings

The concept of adding contacts did not work very well, as probation practitioners would not usually add them to the Part A.

The practitioners were confused about how to add contacts. We noticed that the behaviour of the 2 boxes in the left hand column contributed to this.

The same menus and filters worked fine when we tested the concept of adding breached conditions. The differences here are:
* it’s a more complex left hand column
* adding contacts to the part A is a new concept that was not well understood by users

## Next steps 
It was clear from our findings that the idea of adding contacts to the Part A would have been a huge mental model shift to how the probation practitioners currently fill it in. Due to time constraints it was not possible to explore this idea further at the moment.  

We decided to focus on the biggest insight from this round of research - that getting an auto populated Part A was a big help to practitioners.
