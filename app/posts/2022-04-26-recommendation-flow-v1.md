## Recommendation flow
Building on the work based off Nisha's checklist in the NW region this iteration looks to make the checklist more provocative and stimulate users to consider the whole-picture when deciding whether to recall.

Work started with collating guidance from various training, policy documents and an internal review. All documents listed pointers and considerations before recalling. 

Once patterns and guidance was consolidated the primary themes were made into a series of question pages. Each page approach a theme when considering recall.

### Quotes from users

> "I really like this form, If I was having to recall someone I didn't know, this would make my life easier, look at all the things that need to be in place, discussions happening, not 100% getting you to look at have you thought about abs everything, have you covered everything 
"
>

> "I would be concerned if we hadn't had a conversation with SPO. It's an aide memoire, a duplication of information that you've already got in your head. I think that would add work for me, not otherwise. I already have knowledge of the case. May be helpful for someone less expeirnced, or if recall isn't clear cut. Useful if pre-population of static factors -- some of the risk factors
