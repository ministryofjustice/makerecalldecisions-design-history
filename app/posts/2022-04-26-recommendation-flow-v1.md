## Recommendation flow
Building on the work based off Nisha's checklist in the NW region this iteration looks to make the checklist more provocative and stimulate users to consider the whole-picture when deciding whether to recall.

Work started with collating guidance from various training, policy documents and an internal review. All documents listed pointers and considerations before recalling. 

Once patterns and guidance was consolidated the primary themes were made into a series of question pages. Each page approach a theme when considering recall.
