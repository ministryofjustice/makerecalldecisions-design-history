### Further notes
<p>Assessment was completed on 2nd November 2021 at HMPPS.</p>

<p>During Alpha, the team have carried out extensive user research with frontline staff whose feedback has contributed to prioritisation and design iterations.</p>

<p>It was evident that there had been a decent amount of collaborative working with both the Create and Vary a License team and the Manage a Supervision team in ensuring that there was knowledge sharing across teams that link closely with each other. </p>

<p>The team have identified problems with users having to refer to multiple systems in their decision making process, hence testing the impact of providing a way to view all the information in one  place
</p>

<p>Further exploration is suggested to develop upon the checklist solution for helping practitioners making balanced decisions.
